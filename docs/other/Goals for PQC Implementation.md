# Goals for PQC Implementation

## Introduction
The transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) requires careful planning to decide where and how to implement quantum-resistant algorithms in financial products.

## Goals
### 1. **TLS/SSL for Transactions**
- Secure communication protocols for online transactions.
- Replace current cryptographic methods with PQC algorithms like Kyber.

### 2. **Database Protection**
- Encrypt sensitive data stored in financial databases.
- Use lattice-based encryption methods for enhanced security.

### 3. **Digital Signatures for Documents**
- Ensure authenticity and integrity of critical financial documents.
- Implement algorithms like Dilithium for secure digital signatures.

### 4. **Authentication Systems**
- Enhance user authentication processes with PQC-based digital signatures.
- Improve resistance to quantum attacks on login systems.

## Future Directions
- Identify additional areas for PQC integration, such as API security and IoT devices in financial systems.
- Continuously evaluate PQC algorithms for performance and security.
