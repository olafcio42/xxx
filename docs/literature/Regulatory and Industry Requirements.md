# Regulatory and Industry Requirements

## Introduction
The transition to quantum-resistant cryptography requires consideration of regulatory and industry standards.

## Key Standards
### 1. **PCI DSS**
- Requires encryption of sensitive data.
- PQC algorithms like Kyber can be used to secure transactional data.

### 2. **Banking Security Standards**
- ISO 20022: Securing communication between financial institutions.
- Requirements for digital signatures and data encryption.

### 3. **Government Standards**
- FIPS 140-3: Certification of cryptographic modules.
- Mandates the adoption of PQC algorithms.

## Challenges
- Costs associated with implementation.
- Compatibility with existing systems.

## Conclusion
Integrating PQC in compliance with regulations is crucial for data security in the financial sector.
