# Research on Quantum-Resistant Cryptosystems

## Introduction
The development of quantum computers poses a threat to traditional cryptographic methods, such as RSA and ECC. Quantum-resistant cryptosystems are crucial for the future of data security.

## Key Research Areas
### 1. **Lattice-Based Cryptography**
- High resistance to quantum attacks.
- Research focuses on optimizing algorithms like Kyber and Dilithium.

### 2. **Code-Based Cryptography**
- Utilizes error-correcting codes in cryptography.
- Algorithms like McEliece provide strong quantum attack resistance.

### 3. **Hash-Based Cryptography**
- Algorithms such as SPHINCS+ rely solely on hash functions.
- Independence from mathematical structures enhances security.

## Applications
- Communication protocols (TLS/SSL).
- Secure database storage.
- Digital signatures for documents.

## Conclusion
Research into quantum-resistant cryptosystems is vital for safeguarding data in the quantum era.
